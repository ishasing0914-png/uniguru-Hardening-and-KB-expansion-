# Uni-guru.in Repo Handoff Confirmation

Status: PRE-INTEGRATION — HANDOFF REQUIRED

As per task instructions, live integration work may only begin
after receiving the official Uni-guru.in production repository
from the product owner.

Current State:
- ❌ Production repository not yet received
- ❌ Branch to work on not yet confirmed
- ❌ Folder structure not yet verified
- ❌ KB asset location not yet confirmed
- ❌ Starting commit hash not yet documented

Action Taken:
- No assumptions made about existing or older forks
- No cloning or local setup performed
- No integration, signal verification, or enforcement-adjacent work started

Next Required Step:
- Obtain official repo access from product owner (via WhatsApp)
- Confirm branch, folder structure, and KB asset location
- Record initial commit hash before any live integration work

Compliance Note:
This document satisfies the mandatory “Repo Handoff Confirmation”
deliverable and intentionally blocks integration until handoff
is complete.
