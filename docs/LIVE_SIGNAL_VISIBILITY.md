# Live Signal Visibility — Verification Pending

Purpose:
Document intended signal visibility checks once live UniGuru
production repository access is granted.

Current Status:
- Live production repository access: ❌ NOT AVAILABLE
- Signal paths verified in code: ❌ NOT VERIFIED
- Runtime flow inspection: ❌ NOT PERFORMED

Reason:
- Mandatory repo handoff step has not yet been completed.
- Task rules prohibit assumptions about live behavior.

Planned Verification (Post-Handoff Only):
- Confirm AI Being can read UniGuru signals in live flows
- Ensure signals are observable only
- Confirm no behavior, routing, or enforcement changes occur

Compliance Note:
As instructed:
“If unsure → stop and document.”

No live signal claims are made at this stage.
