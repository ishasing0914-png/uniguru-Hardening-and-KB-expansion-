A qubit is a two-level quantum system that can exist in a linear combination of basis states. Quantum gates are unitary transformations applied to qubits. Quantum circuits are sequences of quantum gates used to perform computations. Entanglement creates correlations between qubits that cannot be explained classically. Measurement projects quantum states onto basis states.
