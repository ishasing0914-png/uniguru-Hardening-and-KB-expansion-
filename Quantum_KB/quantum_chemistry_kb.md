Quantum chemistry applies quantum mechanics to molecular systems. Electronic structure calculations approximate solutions to the Schrödinger equation. Wavefunction-based and density-based methods are commonly used. Basis sets define the mathematical representation of molecular orbitals. Computational accuracy depends on correlation methods and approximations.
