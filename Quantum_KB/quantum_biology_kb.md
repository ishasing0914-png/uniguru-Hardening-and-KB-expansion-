Quantum coherence has been observed in certain biological systems, including photosynthetic complexes. Tunneling effects may influence enzymatic reactions. Research investigates whether quantum phenomena contribute to biological efficiency in energy transfer and sensing. Experimental studies focus on identifying measurable quantum signatures in living systems.
