Quantum systems are represented by state vectors in a complex Hilbert space. Physical observables correspond to Hermitian operators acting on these states. Measurement outcomes are probabilistic and are determined by the eigenvalues of the corresponding operators. The time evolution of a closed quantum system is governed by the Schrödinger equation. Superposition and interference are fundamental features of quantum behavior.
