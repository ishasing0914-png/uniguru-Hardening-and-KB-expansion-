Quantum hardware platforms include superconducting qubits, trapped ions, and photonic systems. Qubits are controlled using electromagnetic fields and laser pulses. Coherence time and gate fidelity are key performance metrics. Error sources include decoherence and operational noise. Hardware design focuses on scalability and stability.
