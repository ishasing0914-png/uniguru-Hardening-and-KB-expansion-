Hilbert spaces provide the mathematical framework for quantum mechanics. Linear operators act on vectors in Hilbert space to represent physical observables. Eigenvalue problems determine measurable quantities. Projection operators describe state changes due to measurement. Inner products define probabilities and expectation values.
