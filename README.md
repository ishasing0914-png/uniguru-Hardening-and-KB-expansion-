# UniGuru Live Integration + Quantum Knowledge Base Expansion

## Overview
This repository contains documentation and read-only knowledge assets prepared for safe integration into the UniGuru live system.

This task was executed under strict safety constraints:
- No runtime logic changes
- No enforcement modifications
- No execution authority added
- No agents introduced into production

The work focuses on:
1. Preparing safe integration documentation
2. Building a read-only Quantum Knowledge Base for future retrieval
